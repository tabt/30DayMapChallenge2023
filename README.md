# 30DayMapChallenge 2023

Maps that I've created in November 2023. It's my first steps in mapping, but you can find some useful code here.

## 01 \| Points

**Shipwrecks around Europe**\
Simple dataset from Kaggle and Mapbox Basemap in Plotly. A good simple map to start with

## 02 \| Lines

**Canals of England and Wales** \
Canals of the UK are cool because they still work, even there are planes, trains and cars. Plotted some open spatial data, not from OSM. It was hard to do nicely in Python, so the result was created in Mapbox Studio

## 03 \| Polygons

**Tokyo subway stations** \
Voronoi diagram of Tokyo subway, plotted with data from OpenStreetMap and postprocessed in Figma

## 04 \| A bad map

**Random pattern with lakes** \
Piece of Earth somewhere in Yakutia. Nothing to do with that

## 05 \| Analog map

**Istanbul sightseeing** \
Not a painter but at least I've tried

![](images/Day5.jpg)

## 06 \| Asia

**Roads of Manila** \
Didn't have much time and found out that R got really nice plots from the box. So it was time to do some R practice after I've finished Google Data Analytics Cert. For the map choose Manila, because it is known as a very congested city.

## 07 \| Navigation

**The Silk Road** \
The silk road and associated places nearby. Data from github.com/dorcas25sg/Silkroad

## 08 \| Africa

**Cairo, Egypt** \
Cairo has a beauiful streets network, with chaotic and ordered lines. Tried to make a map that can hang on a wall in a cafe or smth.

## 09 \| Hexagons

**Rent cost in Barcelona** \
My friend lives near Barcelona, and maybe this vizes will help him somehow. Really like this cmap, but it is a bit impractical

Cost per m^2               |  Cost per month

## 10 \| North America

**UFO Sights** \
QGIS ate all my time with reprojecting DEMs, so I returned to simple Mapbox viz

![](images/Day10.png)

## 11 \| Retro

**Prague** \
First time trying to style maps with QGIS. Prague is one of my favourite European cities. Its streets are giving vibes of the past, inspired by Kafka and Meyrink's stories

![](images/Day11.jpeg)

## 12 \| South America

**Peru** \
I've downloaded Copernicus DEM from ec.europa.eu. After some adjustments in QGIS added tif file as a texture to Blender. Finalized with adding glowing spheres to Lima and Machu Picchu (was kinda hard to find it in the mountaines...)

## 13 \| Choropleth

**Japan life expectancy** \
Found a cool clean dataset on Kaggle with data on Japan aging. There are additional factors, that can correlate with life expectancy. I needed to create just one choropleth, but we can plot and analyse whatever we want

## 14 \| Europe

**Europe Power Plants** \
Colors represent fuel type and size of circles - power

![](images/Day14.png)

## 15 \| OpenStreetMap

**Montaretto, Italy** \
Small town, where I was once in a childhood. Plot was made with R, postprocessing - Figma. Again moving from maps to posters...

![](images/Day15.png)


## 16 \| Oceania

**Airports of Oceania** \
There are a lot of really small islands in Oceania, but still on many of them there is a landing strip, often occupying the largest part of an atoll.

I was trying to make a good map, but no good ideas and methods were in the head. It is sad that such a good theme is so poorly mapped by me

## 17 \| Flow

**Ocean currents** \
Data was taken from earthdata.nasa.gov. Made with Python & Blender
![](images/Day17.png)

## 18 \| Atmosphere

**Air Quality Index** \
The lower the index is - the better is the quality of air. Tried to make it look a bit like a part of an academic paper
![](images/Day18.png)

## 19 \| 5 minute map

**Random DnD map** \
Tried to make a fast map of a fantasy town in http://inkarnate.com. No purpose,  just chaotic houses :)

It's really a great tool for bringing atmosphere into your DnD games!

## 20 \| Outdoors

**Ski trails of Schladming** \
Map of Schladming, town with beautiful mountains and a lot of ski trails! 
When I was there, on top of Planai already were dense snow clouds. So it was useful to have a resort map with ski routes to get out of mist and have a good time!

## 21 \| Raster

**Pixels** \
Raster to pixels & some retro colors. Made in QGIS with tutorial from cartetika.ru
![](images/Day21.png)

## 22 \| North is not always up

**Two-Point Equidistant Projection** \
Two-Point Equidistant Projection preserves distances from two selected points on the map.

Tried to transform to Fuller/Dymaxion in QGIS, but seems that it's something wrong with it - throws errors and no clue :(

## 23 \| 3D

**Iceland** \
Made with Rayshader
![](images/Day23.png)

## 24 \| Black & White

**Venice** \
Simple map with thousands of houses in Venice. Data from OSM
![](images/Day24.png)

## 25 \| Antarctica

**Research stations of Antarctica** \
Wanted to add more labels, but stations are too dense on the edge of the continent. Seems that Baskerville has become my favourite Serif font
![](images/Day25.png)

## 26 \| Minimal

**Bauman University** \
BMSTU buildings and the large point - Baumanskaya subway station. A lot of walks were made through these streets...
