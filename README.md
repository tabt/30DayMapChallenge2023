# 30DayMapChallenge 2023

Maps that I've created in November 2023. It's my first steps in mapping, but you can find some useful code here.

## 01 \| Points

**Shipwrecks around Europe**\
Simple dataset from Kaggle and Mapbox Basemap in Plotly. A good simple map to start with

## 02 \| Lines

**Canals of England and Wales** \
Canals of the UK are cool because they still work, even there are planes, trains and cars. Plotted some open spatial data, not from OSM. It was hard to do nicely in Python, so the result was created in Mapbox Studio

## 03 \| Polygons

**Tokyo subway stations** \
Voronoi diagram of Tokyo subway, plotted with data from OpenStreetMap and postprocessed in Figma

## 04 \| A bad map

**Random pattern with lakes** \
Piece of Earth somewhere in Yakutia. Nothing to do with that

## 05 \| Analog map

**Istanbul sightseeing** \
Not a painter but at least I've tried

## 06 \| Asia

**Roads of Manila** \
Didn't have much time and found out that R got really nice plots from the box. So it was time to do some R practice after I've finished Google Data Analytics Cert. For the map choose Manila, because it is known as a very congested city.

## 07 \| Navigation

**The Silk Road** \
The silk road and associated places nearby. Data from github.com/dorcas25sg/Silkroad

## 08 \| Africa

**Cairo, Egypt** \
Cairo has a beauiful streets network, with chaotic and ordered lines. Tried to make a map that can hang on a wall in a cafe or smth.
